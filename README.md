Hello, Visitor

I am 'Â¿' Don't worry there are no unnecessary charts (I am pretty good at it) focus on my words: every line of code I write it brings out a better version of myself, A melancholy unexplainable to you or a symphony of 0 AND 1 only understandable by CPU. Too much different isn't it ? yeah It is, being different is the key ! a coder whith explorative and experimentative mindset (not a bot) whose experiments create problems unknown which are solved in the most creative ways, resulting in a experience unimagineable by a bot. I don't solve problems which are known already and have predefined answers for it. I am the explorer of the problems unknown. I am the explorer of chaos & peace.

More carefully : Life is an equilibrium of equall and opposite counter parts like peace and chaos, love and hate etc, one cannot exist without other yet they exist equally in combined form. They are spread across with different concentrations which creates chaos tho thier equalising nature creates peace.

Forever satisfied with the holy grail (my code) <br>
